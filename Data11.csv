@Hu Ying@Hu Ying is a kind of Ying bronze ware which is created in 3000 years ago. It is a rare bronze ware of Western Zhou Dynasty. According to some studies, unlike the bronze ware commonly used for sacrifice in the Zhou Dynasty, Ying is a practical instrument for holding water, similar to today's kettle. There are only seven existing Ying in the world.

@Imperial Seal of the Prince of the Dörbed (Four Children) Banner@The Qing emperors consolidated their rule over Inner Mongolia by recognizing the title of prince held by leaders of various Mongol fiefdoms. These fiefdoms were then organized into territorial units known as banners. In return for their loyalty and military support, the princes received full and inalienable rights to rule their banners in alliance with the Qing. To signify that power and authority, the emperor gave each prince a silver seal, surviving examples of which are now exceptionally rare.

@Buddha, Probably Amitabha (Amituofo)@The position of the Buddha’s arms indicates that the hands were once held in a gesture of meditation and suggests that this sculpture represents Amitabha, a celestial Buddha who presides over his Western Paradise. Devotion to Amitabha, a major component of Chinese Buddhist practice since the sixth century, promotes the goal of rebirth in Amitabha’s Pure Land, where conditions are conducive to achieving spiritual understanding. The sculpture was made using the dry-lacquer technique, in which a core is covered with clay and then wrapped in layers of cloth that have been saturated with lacquer. As many as seven or eight additional layers of lacquer might then be applied. @https://collectionapi.metmuseum.org/api/collection/v1/iiif/42163/1838837/main-image@Beijing, China@40.22077@116.23128@early 7th century@@@@@@@Beijing, China@39.928889@116.388333@1917@Sadajirō Yamanaka@@@@@@@@@@@New York, USA@40.713012@-74.00713@1919@The Metropolitan Museum of Art@https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/42163@No

@Emperor Xiaowen and His Court@This piece showing an empress and her attendants, this depiction of an emperor and his entourage once adorned the Central Binyang Cave in the Longmen complex, near Luoyang, in Henan province. It was positioned centrally on the northeast wall between a group of protective semidivinities above and a narrative debate scene below. Xuanwu commissioned the construction of the Central Binyang Cave in honor of his father, the emperor Xiaowen (r. 471–99), and his mother, the dowager Wenzhou (d. 494);@https://collectionapi.metmuseum.org/api/collection/v1/iiif/42707/167173/main-image@Luoyang, China@34.70431@112.51078@ca. 522–23@@@@@1928-1935@story: 20世纪初叶的中国，新旧交换，社会动荡。西方的一些不法之徒与中国古玩奸商相勾结，盗掘古墓、盗卖文物，致使大量文物流失海外。据近代周肇祥《琉璃厂杂记》记述：“河洛之郊，近禁石像出境，外人因变计购佛头。于是，土人斫佛头置筐篮走都下，雕刻精者亦值百数十金。龙门洛阳山壁间法像断首者累累，且有先盗佛头，后运佛身，以其残缺，视为废石，不甚禁阻。抵都，再以灰漆粘合，售巨价。残经毁像，魔鬼时代不图于民国新创见之，可悲也已！” 普爱伦就是那时来到中国的。1928年，普爱伦出任纽约博物馆的远东艺术部主任，成为一个以收集和盗窃中国古代文物为职业的“文物学家”。1930年，他从龙门石窟拍摄大量的照片之后，来到北京物色帮他盗凿《帝后礼佛图》的人选。当时北京琉璃厂最大的古玩铺是由岳彬开的“彬记”。普爱伦指名要岳彬负责“抓货”，他出资收购。经过讨价还价，普爱伦和岳彬达成协议，议定价洋一万四千元。在这份意向书签订之后，岳彬便开始了一系列有计划的盗窃行动。1933至1934年间。岳彬伙通过北京琉璃厂的另一古董商赵鹤舫，联系到洛阳的文物贩子马龙图共同作案。首先，由马龙图出面打通了当地保甲长和地方土匪，取得了他们的支持。然后，他聘请偃师县杨沟村石匠王光喜、王水、王惠成三个人，带上工具和手电进入石窟，对照着普爱伦拍摄的照片，将《帝后礼佛图》一块一块地凿下来。浮雕石像凿下来之后，岳彬又买通当地军阀，以保持偷运安全。全部石像就这样分期分批地被盗凿下来、偷运到北京。到达北京之后，岳彬又聘请高手，对照照片，逐块粘对复原，最后交付给普爱伦。约在1935年，《帝后礼佛图》就已被运出中国，分别出现在美国两个博物馆里。但在当时，普爱伦与岳彬盗凿《帝后礼佛图》的交易一直不为人知，甚至它被盗、被运到美国的确切时间也难以确定。直到1952年，岳彬被人揭发，从他家里搜查出他与普爱伦的协议以及没有粘接上去的几麻袋石头，盗宝一事才被揭露出来。之后岳彬被判死刑，病死狱中。现在美国博物馆里的《帝后礼佛图》因当初的盗凿而千疮百孔，更令人痛惜的是，它的流失造成了龙门石窟永难弥补的残缺。@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@New York, USA@40.713012@-74.00713@1935@The Metropolitan Museum of Art@https://new.qq.com/omn/20180508/20180508A0A8R4.html@Yes

@Night-Shining White@This painting, the most famous work attributed to the artist, is a portrait of a charger of Emperor Xuanzong (r. 712–56). With its burning eye, flaring nostrils, and dancing hoofs, the fiery-tempered horse epitomizes Chinese myths about Central Asian celestial steeds that sweated blood and were actually dragons in disguise.

@Khitan falconer with horse@Hu Huan was a Khitan painter in the early 10th century and was good at drawing nomadic life in the north. Judging from the works currently planned by Hu Huan, many references to the Qidan people's characteristics, customs and clothing are used. Their works are characterized by meaningful details and good use of line outlines. Huo's masterpiece Zhuo Xie Tu has different grades, regardless of pen, ink or structure. Therefore, what exactly is the true face of Hu Xuan's paintings has yet to be further investigated.@https://collections.mfa.org/internal/media/dispatcher/993738/preview@Shijiazhuang, China@38.03647@114.53952@12th century@ Hu Gui@@@@@Juan Yuan@@@@@Wanyan Jingxian@New York, USA@40.713012@-74.00713@1912@Okakura Kakuzo@@@@@@Boston, USA@42.360256@-71.057279@1912@Museum of Fine Arts@https://collections.mfa.org/objects/12966/khitan-falconer-with-horse?ctx=bf8d8941-b891-42fe-adfc-2fa5094d20d1&idx=5@No

@Buddha of Medicine Bhaishajyaguru (Yaoshi fo)@Healing practices, physical and spiritual, played an important role in the transmission of Buddhism throughout Asia. In this mural, Bhaishajyaguru (Yaoshi fo), the Buddha of medicine, wears a red robe and is attended by a large assembly of related deities, including two seated bodhisattvas who hold symbols for the sun and the moon. The twelve warriors, six at each side, symbolize the Buddha’s vows to help others. The robust, full-faced figure and the shallow spatial construction are characteristic of the work of Zhu Haogu, who was active in the early fourteenth century and painted both Buddhist and Daoist imagery.@https://collectionapi.metmuseum.org/api/collection/v1/iiif/42716/174472/main-image@Xi'an, China@34.23053@108.93425@ca. 1319@Guangsheng Temple@New York, USA@40.713012@-74.00713@1929@2 Americans@US@39.999733@-98.678503@@Arthur M.
